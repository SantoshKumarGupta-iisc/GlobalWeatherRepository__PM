Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:-
 Handled missing values using median (numerical) and mode (categorical) imputation.
 Removed outliers using the IQR method.
 Encoded categorical data where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
 Visualized temperature, humidity, and other weather attributes.
 Analyzed correlation between different weather and air quality parameters.

Forecasting Models and Performance:-
 Applied Random Forest and Linear Regression for weather prediction.
 Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Feature Importance:-

Assessed feature importance using Random Forest models.
Identified key weather attributes affecting air quality.

Spatial Analysis:-
Created scatter plots of temperature distribution across latitude and longitude.

Geographical Patterns:-
Compared weather attributes across countries and continents.

Insights and Conclusions:-
Temperature and humidity are highly correlated with air quality.
CO2 and PM2.5 levels are influenced significantly by wind speed and temperature.

Future Scope and Recommendations:-
Develop more complex models for weather prediction.
Integrate additional environmental parameters for better insights.
